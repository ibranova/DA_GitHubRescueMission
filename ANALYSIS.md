## Feedback to Coder Jam to improve their repository

1. There is any image inside the asset folder, so Github cannot find it.
2. The links in the headings do not point to the correct location.
3. There is not a .gitignore file inside the repository, this important to save sensitive informations like passwords or usernames. 
4. There no visual to expain the analysis and any link to the data source.
5. Poor README.md file, any explaination about the process, languages and tools used to do the analysis.
